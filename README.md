# Strive

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.15.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Generate PWA icons
npm run generate:icons
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## PWA Icons

This project includes PWA (Progressive Web App) support with a comprehensive icon set. To update the app icons:

1. Replace the logo file at `public/icons/logo.svg`
2. Run `npm run generate:icons`
3. Commit the generated icons

For detailed instructions, see [PWA Icons Guide](docs/PWA-ICONS.md).
